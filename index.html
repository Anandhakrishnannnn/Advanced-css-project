      <p class="card-text">Aadujeevitham, directed by Blessy and starring Prithviraj Sukumaran, is more than just a film; it's an immersive journey through the human experience.

        The movie begins with a breathtaking visual â€“ a sandstorm followed by a serene desert landscape. From that moment on, I was captivated. The cinematography, coupled with AR Rahman's evocative score, sets the stage for an emotional rollercoaster that grips you from start to finish.
